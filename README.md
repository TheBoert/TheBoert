- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheBoert - The "oe" in my username is a rather sad substitute for the german "ö"-Umlaut. So it really should be @TheBört - which would be a dialectical pronounciation of the last syllabel of my first name, Robert - but unfortunately Sonderzeichen are not allowed in usernames.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in general and especially to automate cumbersome CAD- and GIS-workflows. Curious about AI-uses-cases.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use emacs for .ORG-Mode and Common Lisp, whenever i find the time and the nerves to learn yet more shortcuts i experiment with evil mode. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really at the moment. For now just setting this up to synch my emacs config.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
